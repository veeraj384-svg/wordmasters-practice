<p>
Ruling the kingdom required great
<select data-answer="stamina"></select>,
but the ruler often tried to
<select data-answer="evade"></select>
responsibility. His plans sounded
<select data-answer="sketchy"></select>,
and many feared he had become a true
<select data-answer="tyrant"></select>.
Rather than lead, he chose to
<select data-answer="shirk"></select>
his duties while continuing to
<select data-answer="domineer"></select>
over others.
</p>

<p>
Life in the palace had grown
<select data-answer="mundane"></select>,
and the ruler’s
<select data-answer="disposition"></select>
grew increasingly harsh. Officials would
<select data-answer="bicker"></select>
over small issues, often ignoring basic
<select data-answer="etiquette"></select>
and committing a serious
<select data-answer="faux pas"></select>.
</p>

<p>
A calm and
<select data-answer="amicable"></select>
traveler arrived to test the ruler’s
<select data-answer="mettle"></select>.
He urged the king to
<select data-answer="enact"></select>
fair laws and
<select data-answer="establish"></select>
justice through
<select data-answer="rigorous"></select>
debate rather than force.
</p>

<p>
The argument soon
<select data-answer="peaked"></select>.
Some advisors would
<select data-answer="snicker"></select>,
while others gave a quiet
<select data-answer="sneer"></select>.
The discussions became a constant
<select data-answer="wrangle"></select>,
as the guards, once
<select data-answer="lax"></select>,
now stood alert.
</p>

<p>
By the end, the ruler looked
<select data-answer="haggard"></select>,
standing at the
<select data-answer="threshold"></select>
of losing power. Parts of the palace had become
<select data-answer="derelict"></select>,
and the king finally realized leadership is not something to
<select data-answer="refuse"></select>.
</p>

Tip: If you want a harder version later, I can make it so each word can be used only once.
